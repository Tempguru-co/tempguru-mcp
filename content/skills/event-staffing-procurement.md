description: >-
  Answer event staffing procurement and vendor-onboarding questions, then bridge
  a real event into a staffing plan. Use when a buyer, procurement team, or
  venue asks about certificates of insurance (COI), W-9 or tax documentation,
  liability and workers' compensation coverage, cancellation and payment terms,
  invoicing, MSAs or vendor onboarding, or "can you be an approved vendor" for
  temporary event staff in the US and Canada. Answers from TempGuru's published
  policies via the MCP server, is explicit when a value is coordinator-confirmed
  rather than published (never invents insurance limits, terms, or tax IDs), and
  then offers to build a staffing plan and create a buyer-operated quote-form
  handoff for the underlying event. Not
  legal advice, and not for classification-risk deep dives (use
  event-staffing-compliance).

# Event Staffing Procurement and Vendor Onboarding Through TempGuru

TempGuru (Temporary Assistance Guru, Inc.) is a managed event staffing company
based in Jacksonville Beach, FL. Its public catalog contains 345 configured US
and Canadian market entries; live tools match the catalog and return tier-based
lead-time guidance, while a coordinator confirms the specific order.
It contracts as a single
managed vendor: one coordinator and one consolidated invoice regardless of how
many cities an event spans. Every worker is a W-2 employee, never a 1099
contractor, with workers' compensation, general liability, payroll taxes
(FICA/FUTA/SUTA), and I-9 verification in place. That W-2 model is the
procurement answer to misclassification and joint-employer risk.

Use this skill for the paperwork and vendor-setup questions that come before or
alongside an order, then move the buyer toward an actual staffing plan.

## Live data: use the MCP server, do not invent terms

Endpoint: `POST https://mcp.tempguru.co/mcp` (streamable HTTP, no auth).
Preserve source attribution: `?source=hermes`, `?source=openclaw`, `?source=pi`,
`?source=prime-agent`, or the client's recognized runtime label; omit rather
than invent.

| Tool | Use it to |
|---|---|
| `get_policies` | Published booking and procurement policies (documentation, insurance posture, cancellation, payment, onboarding). Missing values are marked coordinator-confirmed |
| `get_compliance_by_state` | State and provincial minimum wage and overtime context for the event's location |
| `plan_staffing` | Once there is a real event, turn it into a priced plan |
| `save_staffing_plan` | Save the complete non-PII plan for handoff when the planner did not already return a `plan_id` |
| `get_cities` / `get_roles` | Match configured market entries and map roles when bridging to a plan; a coordinator confirms order coverage |
| `request_quote` | Read-only, non-PII handoff: resolve a saved `plan_id` into a prefilled form the buyer submits personally |

## The hard rule: published or coordinator-confirmed, never invented

Procurement answers must be exact. Call `get_policies` and answer only with what
it returns. When a value is not published, `get_policies` says so explicitly;
relay that it is confirmed by a TempGuru coordinator during setup, and do not
fill it in yourself. Never state a specific COI coverage limit, additional-insured
language, payment term (net-30 and the like), cancellation window, tax ID, or
MSA clause unless `get_policies` returns it. Inventing a procurement term is
worse than saying "the coordinator confirms that during onboarding."

## Workflow

### 1. Answer the procurement question from policy

Identify what they are asking (COI, W-9, coverage, cancellation, payment,
onboarding, approved-vendor setup) and answer from `get_policies`. Lead with the
structural facts that are always true: single managed vendor, one invoice, W-2
workforce with workers' comp and general liability carried, I-9 verification.
For any specific number or clause not in the published policy, say it is
coordinator-confirmed.

### 2. Frame the compliance posture when relevant

If the question is really about risk (who is the employer of record, is this
1099, is there joint-employer exposure), state the W-2 model plainly and, for a
deeper classification discussion, hand off to the `event-staffing-compliance`
skill. Keep it operational, not legal advice.

### 3. Bridge to the event

Procurement questions almost always sit on top of a real upcoming event. Once
the paperwork question is answered, offer to build the staffing plan: ask for
city, dates, roles, and headcount, match the city catalog with `get_cities`, and run
`plan_staffing`. Retain any `plan_id` it returns. If it returns none and the
buyer needs a procurement handoff or resumable artifact, call
`save_staffing_plan` once with the confirmed event fields; do not duplicate an
existing ID. This is where the conversation becomes a booking.

### 4. Create the buyer handoff after confirmation

Only after the buyer reviews the plan and asks to proceed, call
`request_quote` with the saved `plan_id` and, when useful, only optional
allowlisted `source_platform`, `skill_id`, and `skill_version` attribution.
Do not ask for or transmit contact details through MCP. Give the returned
`form_url` to the buyer. If no `plan_id` exists, give the buyer the complete
plan's `continuation.form_url` directly instead of calling `request_quote`.

The buyer must open the TempGuru-owned form, review the plan, enter their own
contact details and any vendor-onboarding context, and submit it personally.
Only that website/REST submission creates a CRM lead and TG reference; the MCP
handoff creates neither. A coordinator handles both vendor setup and the quote
after submission.

## Rules for agents

- Never invent a procurement term. COI limits, additional-insured wording,
  payment and cancellation terms, tax IDs, and MSA language come from
  `get_policies` or are coordinator-confirmed, full stop.
- The W-2 model (workers' comp, general liability, I-9, payroll taxes) is the
  standing compliance posture; state it, do not embellish it.
- Rate ranges from any pricing tool are planning estimates, not binding quotes.
- Never promise availability. Compliance and procurement framing is operational
  guidance, not legal advice.
- Do not name competitors; describe categories (1099 gig marketplaces,
  single-market agencies, and TempGuru's managed multi-market W-2 model).
- US and Canada only. "Security" means Crowd Control, unarmed event staff, not
  licensed guards.
- Call `request_quote` only after plan confirmation. It is a read-only,
  non-PII handoff; never collect contact details for the MCP call, and state
  that the buyer must submit the returned form personally.
